    "# Starbucks Customers Segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Starbucks Corporation is an American coffee company. Today, it operates more than 30,000 retail stores in 80 markets around the world.The company hence is a big player in a vigorously competitive industry. One approach to retain customers is its Starbucks Reward Program. Members of the program receive promotional offers. The company then hopes to use the data collected on its customer behavior to create business value and make data-driven decisions on how it engages with its customers base.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Problem Statement\n",
    "The company currently promotes products to customers with no prior knowledge of their segments. It is possible hence to analyse the data to find patterns in customer behaviors. This helps the company in aiming and tailoring its marketing efforts and resources to consumers who exhibit similar characteristics and are considered most likely to opt in for business's offerings. This form of target marketing is important because it helps the company by maximizing revenue while maintaining promotional campaigns cost smartly low. To do this, an unsupervised learning technique will be used to cluster customers into groups that can be be investigated separately to better understand their qualities and engage them accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Measurement Criterias\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Metrics\n",
    "1. Distinguish the difference between how customers behave during non-promotional periods and how they behave when they are prompted to do so during promotionals periods. To measure this, Recency-Frequency-Monetary Analysis) for examining customer value is used. In this model, recency, frequency and monetary values are assigned a score from one to five based on quantiles partition dividing range of values into equal-sized intervals. The RFM score is then obtained by taking the average of all three scores.<br>\n",
    "<br>RFM score <- RFM analysis is a data driven customer behavior segmentation technique. RFM stands for recency, frequency, and monetary value. The idea is to segment customers based on when their last purchase was, how often they've purchased in the past, and how much they've spent overall. <br>\n",
    "<br> Five is the best/highest value, and one is the lowest/worst value. A final RFM score is calculated simply by combining individual RFM score numbers. Remember, RFM values and RFM scores are different. Value is the actual value of R/F/M for that customer, while Score is a number from 1-5 based on the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textrm{RFM}_{score}={\\textrm{recency}_{score}+\\textrm{frequency}_{score}+\\textrm{monetary}_{score}\\over3}$$\n",
    "2. Identify which customers react preferably to which types of offers. To measure this, offer view and completion rates will be used where the cardinalities of corresponding sets are divided by cardinalities of relevant sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textrm{view rate}={n(\\textrm{offer viewed})\\over{n(\\textrm{offer received})}}\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\textrm{completion rate}={n(\\textrm{offer completed})\\over{n(\\textrm{offer viewed})}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:-<br> Recency - The freshness of customer activity, be it  purchases or visits.<br>\n",
    "       Frequency - The frequency of the customer transactions or visits.<br>\n",
    "       Monetary - The intention of customer  to spend or purchasing power of customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Technical Metrics\n",
    "For the algorithm chosen in this problem, K-Means, two appropriate methods will be used find the optimal number of clusters $k$ and to assess the model implementations; silhouette coefficient (SC) analysis and within-cluster Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Silhouette Coefficient (SC) analysis is a way to measure how close each point in a cluster is to the points in its neighboring clusters. Its a neat way to find out the optimum value for k during k-means clustering. Silhouette values lies in the range of [-1, 1]. A value of +1 indicates that the sample is far away from its neighboring cluster and very close to the cluster its assigned. Similarly, value of -1 indicates that the point is close to its neighboring cluster than to the cluster its assigned. And, a value of 0 means at the boundary of the distance between the two cluster. Value of +1 is ideal and -1 is least preferred. Hence, higher the value better is the cluster configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, for one data point $i$ where $a(i)$ represents the calculated mean distance of point $i$ with regard to to all other points in the cluster it was assigned and $b(i)$ represents the calculated mean distance of point $i$ with regard to to all points in its closest neighboring cluster, silhouette is defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s(i)={b(i)-a(i)\\over\\textrm{max}\\{b(i),a(i))\\}}$$\n",
    "Therefore, it is clear from the above equation that$$-1\\leq{s(i)}\\leq1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, for one value representing the silhouette score that used for assessment of clustering outcomes, where $\\bar{s}(k)$ represents the mean $s(i)$ over all data of the entire dataset for a specific number of clusters $k$, silhouette coefficient is defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$SC=\\textrm{max}_k\\{\\bar{s}(k)\\}$$\n",
    "2. Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) analysis is a way to measure variability (dispersion) within a cluster by taking the sum of the squared differences between each data point and its cluster's mean, and therefore defined where $x_i$ is the $i$th data point and $n$ is the total number of data points: [3]\n",
    "\n",
    "$$SSE=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2-{1\\over{n}}\\Bigg(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2\\Bigg)^2$$\n",
    "SSE tends to decrease toward 0 as $k$-value increase because then each data point is its own cluster and there is no error between it and the mean of its cluster. The elbow method is then applied by plotting SSE for a range of $k$-values where where one should choose a $k$-value after which variability starts to have diminishing returns.\n",
